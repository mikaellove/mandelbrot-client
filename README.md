# Mandelbrot Client

The client side of a project that renders the mandelbrot set on to an image.

This server application must be running on the same machine for the client to work properly.
https://github.com/mikaellove/mandelbrot-server.git

When running the application, enter a string with the form height/width/maxIteration/ports into the commandline
and a image will be rendered and written on this path C:\Images\mandelbrot.png.

For now the client and the server app only runs on the localhost.
